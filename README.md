# Neighborhood Analysis Project in Tableau

## Introduction

This project is an analytical dive into the dynamics of various neighborhoods using Tableau. The intent is to provide actionable insights into neighborhood characteristics such as demographics, housing, amenities, and other socioeconomic factors.

## Project Description

Leveraging a robust dataset, the analysis paints a detailed picture of neighborhood life. The goal is to identify patterns and trends that can inform residents, potential homeowners, urban planners, and policy-makers about the current state and potential future of these areas.

## Dataset

The dataset includes a range of variables from population metrics to housing conditions, amenities available, and more. 
## Tools Used

- **Tableau Desktop**: Main tool used for creating detailed and interactive data visualizations.
- **Tableau Public**: For sharing the visualizations online.

## Visualizations

The Tableau workbook (`1.5 Week 2 SM.twbx`) comprises several dashboards and worksheets:
- Dashboard A: (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sab.mahato/viz/1_4week2SM/Sheet1)
- Dashboard B: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sab.mahato/viz/1_5Week2SM/Sheet1


These visualizations can provide insights such as:
- The average housing prices across neighborhoods
- Demographic distributions and their evolution over time
- Access to facilities like parks, schools, and public transport

## How to Access the Visualizations

To access the interactive dashboards:
1. Download the Tableau Public application if you haven't already.
2. Download the `.twbx` file from this repository.
3. Open the file with Tableau Public to interact with the visualizations.
